# book-CLI-app

This is one of my personal projects, a small python CLI App that processes csv files in the folder and populates a local JSON database with transactions.

There are some validation checks and other tests to make sure parsing is successful without issues. The logic is relatively simple yet works well with the data being fed into the app.
It's a personal project so there are no comments and the code will look spaghetti, please ignore the readability on this. This is also my first python project.
